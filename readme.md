Todo before you run the python script:
    - change value of gcp\_enablement\_content\_folder. It should point to where you have cloned the git repository.

If you're testing code, make updates to the file sample\_data/madeup/en.md. Then check if it works by running the python code. (Your python executable might be different):
    - python3 main.py sample\_data/madeup
